Made a simple rock paper scissors program in java.

Honestly this program was harder than the to-do list.
Mostly because I was having trouble with the Scanner object.
It was throwing an error I had never seen before at me but I managed to make it work somehow.
I think the problem had something to do with the fact that I had 2 scanner objects rather than 1.
Once I lessened the amount to 1, the program seemed to work perfectly.

I definitely had more fun making this program than the to-do list.
